## Docs & Demo

* **Demo**: [Overview of all icons](docs/icons-demo.md) contains simple webfont-based demo
* **Download**: clone or [download ZIP](https://github.com/allienworks/cryptocoins/archive/master.zip) directly from GitHub


## Installation

There are many ways/formats how to use Cryptocoins. The fastest and recommended way is via SVG directly. Or use the webfont version if you want to include all icons at once:

* **[via SVG](https://github.com/allienworks/cryptocoins/wiki/SVG-version)** `recommended` – when you need just a few icons in your project
* [Webfont version](https://github.com/allienworks/cryptocoins/wiki/Webfont-version) – ideal when you want to include all icons at once
    - _Pro tip:_ [Learn how to generate icon webfonts](https://allien.work/blog/howto-generate-icon-webfont) – it's even better when you only include those you really need
* NPM package – `npm i cryptocoins-icons`
* Both [svg icons](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/cryptocoins-icons?path=SVG) and [the webfont](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/cryptocoins-icons?path=webfont) are also available on [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/cryptocoins-icons)

## Requesting new icons

Initial release contains just a fraction of Altcoins. If you're missing your coin, please let me know so I can include it in next release. Since there are many requests lately and I can hardly keep up, **I have to ask you to follow these guidelines**:

1. [open a new issue](https://github.com/allienworks/cryptocoins/issues/new) in this repo
2. fill in the template (coin name, ticker symbol, link to official logo etc.)
3. _(optional)_ you can include HEX code of the main color used in coin's branding and bitcointalk thread link (not mandatory, but saves me time)
4. (optional) you can notify me on [@AllienWorks](https://twitter.com/AllienWorks) Twitter (also, helps spreading the word)

**This is all completely voluntary work**, so if you want to support my efforts _or_ speed up the addition of your coin, [please donate](https://allien.work/donate). Donation addresses are found below (if you don't see your coin, let me know and I'll send the address afterwards).
